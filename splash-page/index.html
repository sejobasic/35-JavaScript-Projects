        <strong>Freshly Ground</strong> puts an emphasis on locking in freshness
        during the post-roast process by sealing their bags immediately. The
        care that is involved in this process allows both blends and single
        origin beans to fully display their flavors with every swig.
        <strong>Freshly Ground</strong> does come at a slightly higher price
        point, but it is good enough to save you money by turning your kitchen
        into your new favorite café.
